# Capsule-Network-Implementation
A neural capsule for an University project

This is a personal implementation of a Capsule Neaural network base on the paper Dynamic Routing Between Capsules (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09829.pdf) by Geoffrey Hinton.

Train and test are performed on the MNIST Dataset.

The file GIFs.rar contains 13 gifs that shows what happens if we decide to manually tune up or down the parameters inside the DigitCaps
